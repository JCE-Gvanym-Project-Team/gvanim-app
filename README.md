# Introduction
The project focuses on recruitment management for the "Gvanim" association. "Gvanim" is an association that employs social workers, volunteers, and caregivers for people with physical disabilities or people on the autism spectrum.

The association has encountered difficulties managing recruitment processes in society, and all management has been done so far through Excel, which has created significant difficulties in management.

We were asked to create a website that would manage the recruitment system. Recruiters will be able to upload job openings, candidates will upload their resumes, and the recruiter from their interface will be able to easily view submissions. Each candidate will have a profile where recruiters can keep notes, interview summaries, send generic emails, and keep the candidate's details for future reference. 

# Website Link
```https://gvanim-app.web.app```
- you can also find the website if you go to ```https://www.gvanim.org.il/he``` and click the "Drushim" button


# Coding Conventions
- variable and function names: mainPageAndAnotherWord instead of main_page_and_another_word. also no capital letters at the start of the word
- no css at all inside a .tsx file
- spacing: tab = 4 spaces
- always document your functions, and components
- identation: always format your files
- use Material-UI for basic components, and React Router to traverse between pages
- use the Components folder (there is one inside the folder you are working on) to add new files to the project, those files should represent a Component with some kind of meaning, for example a component called "Navbar" will represent the top of the page, and will contain all the code for it
- Design the website with mobile integration in mind, don't forget to read the requirements.
