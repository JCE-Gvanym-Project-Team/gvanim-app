# This Is The Base App To Copy And Change

I used `npx create-react-app .` <br> From here each of us will create a branch and work on it separately.


## How To Branch And Run On Your PC
* Create a new branch
* Open your terminal
* Execute `npm install` (this will install all the dependencies you need in order to run the app).
* Change the code inside the src folder as you wish
* Execute `npm start` to run your app
* test
